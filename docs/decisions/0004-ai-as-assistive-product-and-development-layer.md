# 0004: AI As An Assistive Product And Development Layer

Date: 2026-05-23

## Decision

Wayfindr may use Laravel's first-party AI tooling as an assistive layer for
product features and project development, but AI must not become a buzzword,
default behavior, or substitute for clear support workflows.

AI features should be optional, disabled unless configured, and designed around
specific user outcomes:

- help agents understand conversations faster,
- help agents draft better replies while keeping humans in control,
- help teams summarize and route support work,
- help self-hosters and contributors inspect and operate Wayfindr safely.

Wayfindr should prefer Laravel-native AI primitives when they fit the job:
agents, structured output, queueing, streaming, provider configuration,
testing fakes, and MCP servers/tools. If the Laravel layer is still too new for
a given production path, Wayfindr should isolate that integration behind a
small internal boundary rather than scattering provider-specific code through
the product.

## Rationale

Wayfindr is a support platform. Support conversations already contain rich
context, uncertainty, and time pressure, which makes them a natural place for
thoughtful AI assistance.

That does not mean every workflow needs AI. The product should stay useful when
AI is unavailable, unconfigured, expensive, or inappropriate for a team's data
policy. Users should be able to run Wayfindr as a normal Laravel support app
without configuring model providers.

The project is Laravel-first, so Laravel's AI SDK and MCP tooling are a strong
fit when Wayfindr needs AI capabilities:

- the APIs match the Laravel application shape,
- provider credentials and defaults can live in normal Laravel config,
- heavy AI work can run through Laravel queues,
- structured output can keep AI features predictable,
- built-in fakes make AI behavior testable without calling live providers,
- MCP can expose safe project and runtime context to development agents.

## Guardrails

- AI is assistive by default. It may draft, summarize, classify, search, or
  explain; it should not send customer-facing replies or take irreversible
  actions without a human approving the result.
- AI must be optional for self-hosters. Missing provider keys should not break
  the core chat, cobrowse, ticketing, or admin experience.
- AI must respect support privacy. Prompts should use the minimum context
  needed, honor masking and retention rules, and avoid sending secrets,
  credentials, payment data, or unnecessary personal data to model providers.
- AI output should be marked as generated or suggested when shown to agents.
- AI actions should be auditable when they affect support records.
- AI behavior should be covered by automated tests using fakes, fixtures, and
  structured output assertions instead of relying on live model calls.
- AI provider choices should remain configurable. Wayfindr should not hard-code
  one commercial provider into product logic.
- AI should not be used as marketing filler. If a feature is not materially
  better with AI, it should stay a normal deterministic workflow.

## Initial Product Uses

The first product-facing AI features should stay low-risk and agent-controlled:

- draft an agent reply for the current conversation,
- summarize a conversation timeline,
- suggest a ticket title, priority, tags, or next step,
- suggest relevant knowledge snippets once a knowledge base exists,
- transcribe or summarize audio only after explicit file and retention controls
  exist.

Autonomous support replies, broad customer-data analysis, and background
training/export workflows are out of scope until the privacy, audit, consent,
and evaluation model is much more mature.

## Initial Development Uses

AI can also improve how Wayfindr is built and operated:

- expose local MCP resources for routes, config shape, docs, and smoke-test
  helpers,
- provide safe diagnostic tools for local and staging support data,
- generate draft operational summaries from deployment or smoke-test evidence,
- help contributors understand Wayfindr's domain model without granting access
  to secrets or private business notes.

Development-facing AI tools should default to read-only access. Any write or
mutation capability must be explicit, narrow, and documented.

## Consequences

- AI package installation, provider environment variables, queue/process needs,
  and Forge notes should be documented when the first AI runtime slice lands.
- AI feature slices should include tests that run without live provider keys.
- Product documentation should describe what context an AI feature uses and who
  approves the result.
- Public examples should use fake or synthetic support data.
- Private customer transcripts, provider keys, prompts containing sensitive
  data, and evaluation datasets with real user information must not be committed
  to the public repository.
